# N.E.R.D CodeLibrary 
> Fun with data structures and algorithms, solving complex problems, wrap up basic stuffs, enhance the problem solvinig skills.

**N.E.R.D**  is personal offline collection of codes of algorithms, data structure, interview coding problems,progrmming language basic stuffs, one will ever encounter and use in after starting programming. 
This provides solutions is in various languages spanning `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Python`.

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)

> Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment.Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine (JVM).
