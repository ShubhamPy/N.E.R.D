**N.E.R.D**  is personal offline collection of codes of algorithms, data structure, interview coding problems,progrmming language basic stuffs, one will ever encounter and use in after starting programming. 
This provides solutions is in various languages spanning `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Python`.
